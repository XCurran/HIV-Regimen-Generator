		<h1> What is the HIV Regimen Generator? </h1>
		
		<div id="speech">
			<p>
				The HIV Regimen Generator is a web application that generates suitable medical regimens with the corresponding
				dosages and related information based on the patient's physical and medical background.

		<h1> Why does this exist? </h1>
		
		<div id="speech">
			<p>
				17 HIV Antiretroviral (ARV) medications have been approved for use in children. This results in
				various regimens available for use, as usually most children need to be on 3 medications at
				once. There are many factors to consider when initiating ARVs in children as many medications
				have different toxicities and side effects (including affecting growth, hormones, kidneys etc).
				Also, certain viruses may be resistant to some medications and not others. Some medications
				will interact with other HIV or non HIV medications. Some medications come in liquids,
				dissolvable tablets, or pills which can affect what age children can take them or not. Also, FDA
				approval for certain medications depends on: age, weight etc. Drug insurance will only cover
				some medications. Therefore, it is very challenging to decide on a regimen given the multiple
				permutations.
